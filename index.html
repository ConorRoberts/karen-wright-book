            <h2>Stop being "the strong one" and start being you.</h2>
            <p>You're doing it all, and it's too much. Between work, kids, parents, money, meals, and everything else on your plate, it's no wonder you're exhausted. You feel alone, misunderstood, and sometimes - hopeless. Because let's face it, this idea of being a "strong woman" is highly overrated.</p>
            <p>But what if there were another way? What if we put limits and boundaries around what it means to be a strong? What if you could be strong and ask for help? What if you could be independant without feeling so alone?</p>
            <p>Karen Wright is one of the most experienced, skilled, and respected executive coaches in the world. And, as a business owner, single parent, and sole provider, she has lived the "I'm doing it all" life. In <i>The Accidental Alpha Woman</i>, she combines what she's learned on her personal journey with what she knows professionally to provide a simple but powerful framework to solve this whole "strong woman" problem</p>
            <p><i>The Accidental Alpha Woman</i>, you'll learn:</p>
